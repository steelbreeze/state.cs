Hierarchical finite state machine for .NET.
  
If you like state.cs, please star it.

## Introduction
State.js provides a hierarchical state machine capable of managing orthogonal regions; a variety of pseudo state kinds are implemented including initial, shallow & deep history, choice, junction and entry & exit points.

State.cs is a C# implementation of a state machine library that largely follows UML 2 state machine semantics. Given the need to make this an executable model, there are certain features that are not supported, please read [UML compliance](https://github.com/steelbreeze/state.cs/wiki/UML Compliance) for more information.

## Versioning
The versions are in the form {major}.{minor}.{build}
* Major changes introduce significant new behaviour and will update the [public API](http://www.steelbreeze.net/state.cs/API.pdf).
* Minor changes introduce features, bug fixes, etc, but note that they also may break the public API.
* Build changes can introduce features, though usually are fixes and performance enhancements; these will never break the public API.

## Documentation
Documentation for the v5 release is underway...

Please see [API documentation](http://www.steelbreeze.net/state.cs/API.pdf) for documentation on the v4.x code base.

## Building state.cs
Simply add all the .cs files and the resources to an existing or new assembly. That's it...

## Usage
If you're using state.cs, please drop me a mail; I'd love to hear about how this is getting used...

## License
state.cs is dual licenced under The MIT License (MIT) and GPL v3
